-> Dependency Injection in Spring
Technique where Spring creates and connects objects for us, we don't have to manually set them up, which makes managing app easier.


-> Explain difference between constructor injection and setter injection
Constructor injection in Spring passes dependencies into an object through its constructor when the object is created.
Setter injection uses method to set an object's dependency after it has been constructed.


-> How @Autowired, @Resource and @Inject differ from each other?
@Resource will narrow down the search first by name, then by type.
@Autowired will narrow down the search by type, then qualifier and finally by the name.
@Inject performs injection by type.


-> Purpose of @Qualifier annotation in Spring
When we need to create and use custom qualifier
